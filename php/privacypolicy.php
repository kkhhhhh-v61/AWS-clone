                <h1>Disclosure Of Information</h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">One of our core principles states that your data will
                    be treated with confidentiality. We will not sell your data to
                    third parties. If required by law your data may be disclosed to
                    third parties. If required due to business requirements and provided
                    that it is allowed under applicable law, we will transfer your data
                    to other companies of Blooms Co. In all other cases,
                    data will not be transferred without obtaining your prior consent.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">We may use service providers and data processors working
                    on behalf of Blooms Co. The services can include hosting and
                    maintenance services, analysis services, e-mail messaging services,
                    delivery services, handling of payment transactions, solvency check
                    and address check, etc. These third parties are granted access to such
                    personal data they require in order to be able to carry out the
                    particular service. The service providers and data processors are
                    contractually obliged to treat such information in the strictest
                    confidence. It is also contractually forbidden for them to use the
                    data in any other way than required. The necessary steps are taken
                    to ensure that our service providers and the processors working on
                    behalf of Blooms Co. protect the confidentiality of your data.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">There may be occasions on which we disclose non-personal
                    data to our partners in an anonymised form. Such non-personal data
                    includes, for example, information about the number of visitors to
                    a website during a certain period of time.
                    Such information is generally only disclosed in a 'bundled' form.</p>
